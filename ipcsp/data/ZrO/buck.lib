#  WOODLEY -library of potentials for GULP
#
#  from S.M.Woodley, P.D.Battle, J.D.Gale and C.R.A.Catlow
#  Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 1, 2535-2542 (1999).
#
#  The O-O potential parameters are identical to those given
#  by Bush. Hence they can be used with the bush set Xi-O 
#  where Xi = Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Fe3+, Ti4+, 
#  Al3+, Ga3+, Y3+, Pr3+, Nd3+, Gd3+, Eu3+, Tb3+, Yb3+, La3+ 
#  and i refers to the oxidation or charge on the cation core.
#  These values can be obtained by returning to the periodic
#  table and clicking on "O" then "Bush 1994".
